# Course Project

**Individual or Team of 2 or 3 Students**

In this course project, you will contribute to an open-source project on GitHub. Your main goal is to develop and submit a major enhancement, bug fix, or new feature. Strive to make contributions that are well-crafted and likely to be accepted by the project's maintainers.

Your tasks include selecting an open-source project, identifying a specific area for improvement, comprehending the project’s contribution guidelines, engaging actively in the project community, documenting your process, and reflecting on the experience gained.

You have a wide latitude in choosing the project and the type of contribution, within certain guidelines and recommendations. Your choice should be informed by your capacity to meet all project requirements. Be cautious in selecting a project or task that might impede your ability to fulfill these requirements.

```{admonition} The Opportunity...
:class: tip
Consider this project as an opportunity to stand out in technical interviews, especially with high-profile companies. Choose a task that demonstrates your capabilities beyond mere complexity. Factors like the codebase size, developer community, development rigor, testing, quality assurance, and adherence to project architecture may be particularly impressive to some employers.
```

## Requirements

These requirements are mandatory for project/task selection:

1. **Time Commitment**: Allocate a minimum of 24 hours per team member. This might include around 7 hours for project selection and context understanding, 12 hours for work list preparation, designing, and implementing changes, and 5 hours for reflection and report writing.
2. **Task Selection**: Choose either one large task or multiple smaller ones. For team projects, the workload should be proportionately increased. Ensure the tasks are appropriate for teamwork and suit your team size. You may list several tasks and stop after completing a few, as long as you meet the time requirement and have necessary reporting materials. Alternatively, you can break down a large task into smaller parts and stop once the required time is devoted.
3. **Task Source**: Tasks must come from a bug report or feature request in the project's public issue tracker on GitHub. Follow the project's protocols for communication and issue tracking.
4. **Project Familiarity**: You are free to select a project you are already familiar with, or explore new areas for learning. Both approaches are valid.
5. **Single Project Focus**: Focus on only one project throughout the course. This applies to teams as well.
6. **Avoid Personal Projects**: Do not select a project that you or another UC student own or manage. Projects managed by non-student UC organizations are allowed.
7. **Originality of Tasks**: The bug report or feature request should not be created by you. Avoid fabricating a project need.
8. **Avoid Conflicts of Interest**: Do not choose issues created by another UC student or have your code reviewed by them. Avoid projects where you have a conflict of interest.
9. **Code Modification Requirement**: The task must involve changes to the project's source code. Tasks focused only on graphics, documentation, or design are not acceptable.

## Recommendations

While these are not mandatory, ignoring them could lead to a lower grade:

1. Choose an active project with many contributors, as indicated by GitHub's statistics.
2. Avoid tasks that are solely about implementing an algorithm or data structure.
3. Select tasks involving more than just frontend development or those without a testing component.
4. Avoid tasks requiring access to sensitive information that cannot be included in your report.
5. Be mindful that your chosen task might be completed by another contributor before you.
6. Acceptance of your contribution is not a requirement for full credit. Grading is based on a specific rubric focused on various aspects of your work.
7. Consider going beyond the project's strict requirements to enrich your report, like discussing non-functional requirements with a project maintainer.
